The library for sneaking on committers! 

For example we see Barry Warsaw committing around 03am on sunday 
you'll be sure that he has a high probability
of being at his PC on that day.

We see that Mr. Guido has his free time everyday around 07am (He has the 
least probability of being at his PC everyday at 07am, that leaves
room for the possibility that he's surfing the internet at that time. 
Free times are poor clues by themselves.)

Mr. Jack Jansen seems to return home around 6pm, maybe he's on his transport around
that time. He's also seen leaving much uncommitted times in the morning, which 
suggests that maybe he's preparing to leave home and take his transport. He maybe 
uses public transport.

The most probable time you'll see Brett Cannon at his PC is on a Friday at 4pm.

Psst. those are just assumptions!

Here are the patterns for the top 30 committers of cpython:
'''
    )

# pics
names = top_committers('data/cpython_log.txt', 30, return_names=True)
for name in names:
    w.write(
'''
![{0}](pics/{1}.png)
'''.format(name, name.replace(' ', '_'))
    )

### def to_json_file(data, filename):

converts dictionary to .json file

### def parse_log(file_name):

returns generated data (by the command 

git shortlog --format=format:%cI > log.txt)

in the repository. returns dict:
```
{
    "4kir4": [
        "2017-03-20T08:44:46+02:00"
    ],
    "A. Jesse Jiryu Davis": [
        "2018-06-04T19:57:08+09:00"
    ],
    "AMIR": [
        "2019-10-22T21:05:54-03:00"
    ], ...
```

### def get_clean_data(logfilename):

    produces data in the format:
```
    "Abdur-Rahmaan Janhangeer": {
        "monday": {
            "commits": 19,
            "times": [
                "2019-03-11@06:42:39",

            ]
        },
        "tuesday": {
        ...
    }
```

### def merge_names(clean_data, namelist, default=None):

namelist is a list of names to be grouped under a default name.
one thing is that people sometimes commit under different names.
modifies clean data

### def plot_user(data, name, alpha=0.1):

plots chart for single user where data is clean_data

### def save_user_plot(data, name, alpha=0.01):

save chart for single user where data is clean_data

### def save_users_plot(data, names, alpha=0.1):

save chart for multiple users

### def top_committers(filepath, number, return_=False, return_names=False):

no return prints out
